# PyBer Analysis
## Project Overview
This project consisted of the exploration of ride-sharing data to provide visualizations based on which communities need to be funded in order to improve the access to locals for ride-sharing services.

## PyBer Analysis Results
The data reflects that ride-sharing is less accessible as you get further from the city center. The data also reflects that the cost of ride-sharing rises as the distance from the city center increases. This impacts the number of Total Riders per city type.  Rural areas had the least number of rides with a total of 125 as compared to Suburban with a 625 and Urban with 1625.  78 people used ride-sharing services in Rural areas as compared to Urban areas with a total of 2405. This is due to people's lack of accessibility to transportation depending on where they are located, whether it be close or far away from city centers.

The following line graph below displays the disparity of fares across different city types.

## Summary
There are two significant strategies that Pyber can consider to increase revenue. One strategy is to increase the number of drivers in rural areas. This will ensure that there are enough drivers to meet ride demand, as the data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than in suburban and urban cities. This indicates that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance, resulting in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.

Another strategy that Pyber can consider is to adjust the fare prices for rural areas. This could help to incentivize drivers to work in these areas, and would also help to cover the increased costs associated with providing service in rural areas.
